# Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection in Angular

- Checkout Branch `csrf-prevention` (`git checkout csrf-prevention`)
- We need a backend in order to implement Angular CSRF-protection: `cd src/server && npm i`
- To start the Server run `npm run start:server` from the root directory
- In order to get a Token we need to login: username: User1 and password: password1
- Add CSRF-Prevention to you HttpClient: `provideHttpClient(withXsrfConfiguration({}))`
- In order to tell Angular to use the cookie we need to set the Attribute `{ withCredentials: true }` on or Http Request
- Investigate your Requests (by Opening the Network Tap on your Browser) and make sure the XSRF-Token is send

### Hints
```typescript
//app.config.ts
  providers: [
  provideHttpClient(withXsrfConfiguration({})),
  provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())
]

//login.component.ts
this.http.get<{ views: number }>('http://localhost:3000/view', {withCredentials: true})
```
