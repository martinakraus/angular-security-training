# Setup and Preparation
1. Clone the demo Repo `git clone https://github.com/martinakraus/angular-security`.
2. Install the dependencies: `cd angular-security` and `npm install`
3. You also need a dummy-backend: By running `npx bookmonkey-api` you should be see an output like `JSON Server is running on port 4730`
4. By visiting `http://localhost:4730/` in your Browser you should be able to see a swagger UI. The books are available at `http://localhost:4730/books`
5. Starting the Angular Application: `npm start`

Note: This Repo contains different Branches for the exercises. The `main` branch hasn't anything implemented yet.
